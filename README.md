SRT 411 Assignment 0 Description 

Assignment 0 provides a short and simple introduction to Rcode and Rstudio. It gives insight on the functionality of Rcode while providing examples and "ToDo's" to follow along such as calculations, graphing, and making simple functions.

Assignment Instructions:
For the purpose of this Assignment, a document provided by Cran Project, contributed by Paul Torfs and Claudia Brauer, was used to replicate the listed ToDo's in a personal Rstudio enviroment. They provided explanations to many functions and methods of using Rstudio such as for calculatiions, mathemetical functions, creating graphs using random numbers, matrices, vectors and much more. The document consisted of 14 examples and practice questions called "ToDo's" and a footnote at the end informing of another method to complete ToDo 14, which was added as an extra ToDO resulting in a total of 15 covered in this assignment. The link to the document providing the practice and the 14 ToDo examples, called, "A (very) Short Introduction to R" is given below. 

Along with this readme, this repository contains a knitr PDF of all the code created in this assignment as well as the results. In addition, there is a .rmd file containing the code compatible to be opened in Rstudio where the code can be run to view the results.

The document of use and ToDo's were found on the link below.
